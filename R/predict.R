#' @title Prediction for a Fitted "mp" Object
#'
#' @description This function predicts optimal treatment of new subjects for a mpersonalized model.
#' If different rules are used in the fitting procedure, an overall treatment recommendation
#' based on all stuides/outcomes could be provided together with optimal treatments for
#' each study/outcome.
#'
#' @details This function predicts for each penalty parameter in the
#' \code{penalty_parameter_sequence} of the "mp" object. The overall recommended treatment is
#' given as an weighted average of the recommended treatments from each study/outcome, and the weight
#' can be specified by user.
#'
#' @param mp A fitted "mp" object returned by "mpersonalized"
#' @param newx  Covariate matrix of new patients. If not supplied, by default the prediction
#' is for the original dataset in the "mp" object. Notice: when \code{problem = "meta-analysis"} and
#' the prediction is for the original dataset, subjects in each study are only predicted
#' using the treatment recommendation rule of the study they belong to.
#' @param overall_rec A logical value. If \code{overall_rec = TRUE}, an overall recommendation will
#' be provided as an weighted average of the optimal treatment from each individual study/outcome. Only useful
#' when \code{newx} is provided.
#' @param weight A weight vector for the overall recommendation, only needed when \code{overall_rec = TRUE}.
#' By default, equal weights are assigned to each study/outcome.
#'
#' @return A list object of two elements.
#' .
#'
#' \item{opt_treatment}{A list object with each element denoting the prediction based on a penalty parameter
#' configuration in \code{mp$penalty_parameter_sequence}. Specifically, if \code{newx} is provided,
#' each element is a recommendation matrix with each row denoting a subject and each column denoting
#' a study/outcome; otherwise, each element is a list of vectors with each vector representing the optimal treatment
#' for each study/outcome. If \code{overall_rec = TRUE},
#' the weighted overall recommended treatment will be further provided as well.
#' If the overall recommened treatment is equal to 0.5, it means the weighted sum is equal for 0 and 1.}
#' \item{benefit_score}{A list object of benefit scores computed from \eqn{g_1, \dots, g_K}. Similar structure as
#' \code{opt_treatment}.}
