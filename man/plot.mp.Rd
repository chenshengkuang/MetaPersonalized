\title{Interaction Plot for an "mp" Class Object.}
\usage{
\method{plot}{mp}(mp, penalty_index)
}
\arguments{
\item{mp}{A fitted "mp" class object returned by \code{mpersonalzied} function}

\item{penalty_index}{The index of penalty parameter configuration in \code{mp$penalty_parameter_sequence}.
When \code{mp$penalty = "none"}, \code{penalty_index} is automatically set to be 1.}
}
\value{
A list object with each element as the interaction plots for a penalty parameter configuration.
}
\description{
This function plots interaction between received treatment and recommended treatment,
which provides an estimate of treatment effect of the identified subgroup.
}
\details{
In the interaction plot, each point is the group mean given a received treatment
and a recommended treatment. Although usually
overestimating treatment effect in training set, interaction plots provides a sanity check for treatment
recommendation rules. Given a specific index of penalty parameter, the function
plots corresponding interaction plots.
