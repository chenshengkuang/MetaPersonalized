\title{Interaction Plot for an "mp_cv" Class Object.}
\usage{
\method{plot}{mp_cv}(mp_cv)
}
\arguments{
\item{mp_cv}{A fitted 'mp_cv' class object returned by \code{mpersonalzied_cv} function}
}
\value{
A list object representing the interaction plots for the optimal penalty parameter configuration.
Specifically, \eqn{k}th element is the interaction plot for the \eqn{k}th study/outcome.
}
\description{
This function plots interaction between received treatment and recommended treatment,
given the optimal penalty parameter.
