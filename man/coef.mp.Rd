\title{Coefficients of a Fitted "mp" Object}
\usage{
\method{coef}{mp}(mp)
}
\arguments{
\item{mp}{A fitted "mp" object returned by "mpersonalized".}
}
\value{
A list object. Each element in the list is the fitted coefficients
corresponding to one penalty parameter value in \code{mp$penalty_parameter_sequence}.
}
\description{
This function provides \code{coef} method for "mp" class objects.
